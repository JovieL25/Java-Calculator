{\huge Selection of Technology}

In order to complete the project, our team needs software support, thus three types of technologies are decided and used by our team:

1. Communication and interaction, in our team, since most of the team members (six out of seven) are familiar and comfortable with WeChat, we finally decided to use it as our communication tool, as well as hold team meetings. Moreover, WeChat is a convenient software, it can be access from all types of devices, and more importantly, it allows to create unlimited number of group chat. Thus, our group could be subdivided into several groups and each concentrates on different tasks without influence the others.

2. Version control, also it is very important and necessary to keep everyone working on the up-to-date source codes and documents, our team decided to use GitHub for version control.

3. Programming language, our team went through a discussion about  Python or Java for our project, and finally decided to use Java as our development language. Because: 1. most of the team members are comfortable with Java, we don't want to invest lots of time learning a new language. 2. Java has many libraries that we could use for implementing GUI and unit testing.
